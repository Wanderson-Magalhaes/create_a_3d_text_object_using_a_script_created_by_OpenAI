# Script Created For Blender 3D Using OpenAI
Addon created for Blender using Open AI

# Used Argument
```
Write an addon for Blender 3.4 for me.
This addon will have a panel in the 3D View called "Create 3D Text", inside that panel we will have a text type field with the default text "My Text", right below this text field we will have a button called "Create 3D Text" when this button is clicked it will take the text contained in the text field above and will create a text object in the 3D interface that will have in its body the same text as the text field of the panel we just created.
```

Both script versions are on GitHub for testing
